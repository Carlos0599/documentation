The [Campaign Monitor](http://profilepress.net/downloads/campaignmonitor/) extension integrates your ProfilePress powered [registration page](../build/registration-form.md) with Campaign Monitor by automatically subscribing users to a specific list immediately they complete registering an account.


To get this feature working on your WordPress powered site, ensure you have the [extension](http://profilepress.net/downloads/campaignmonitor/) installed and activated.


Click the **Extras** ProfilePress menu link.


At the **Campaign Monitor Settings** section, enter your Campaign Monitor account [API key](http://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx?t=206) into the API field and hit the `Save Changes` button for the plugin to fetch your mailing lists.


Select the list you want users to be subscribed to and save the changes.

To give users the option to decide whether to opt in or not to your list, add the shortcode `[pp-campaignmonitor]` to your custom [registration form](../build/registration-form.md).


The shortcode displays a checkbox alongside the label **Subscribe to our email list.** The label can be changed by entering your desired text into the `Checkbox Label` text field.

**Note:** If the Campaign Monitor checkbox isn't present in the registration form but the feature is still activated, new users will still be added to the list.

[ProfilePress](http://profilepress.net/pricing/) passwordless module allows users to log in to your WordPress powered site via a one-time URL sent to their email address which expires by default in 10mins.


## How It Works

Immediately users click the submit button of the [login form](../build/login-form.md) after entering their username in the username form field, they will receive an email containing a URL or link.

If the link is clicked, the user will automatically be logged in to your site.


## Set Up

Although this feature works in any existing login form in your site, be it WordPress default login or logins powered by ProfilePress; I will advice you create a new [login form](../build/login-forms.md) without the password field obviously because, it won't be necessary.


To set up the passwordless one-time login feature, follow the instructions below.


* click the **Extras** ProfilePress menu
* In **One-time Passwordless Login Configuration** page section, activate the feature.
